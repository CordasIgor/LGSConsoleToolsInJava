# LGSConsoleToolsInJava
Console wrappers for LGS screen functionality

This is my copy of https://github.com/djpowell/lcdjni with modifications to build 2 jars to use from console to show text and image on monochromatic display.
I should probably fork the original and than do these changes of mien on that fork (with refactored code and fixed dependencies)...
